# Artemisa
by Diana Nu√±o

###### A complete solution for you.

Artemisa was made for enterprises administration, sales, human resources, and in fact, everything else in the sales enterprise management. This system is still in development and in process to become totally flexible and moldable, adaptive to any kind of enterprise out there.

### Main architecture description

Artemisa was build originally in Node.js, this repository is for the main server C# (dotnet core) version with no more than REST communication between clients and server. This will permit the creation of any other kind of client (web, mobile, desktop...) easier.

For further information and references, please visit Artemisa Node repository (https://github.com/DianaLeNeant/ArtemisaNode).
  
No more readme notes for now. Documentation will expand from now.
